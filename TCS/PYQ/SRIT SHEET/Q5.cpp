/* Q5: Problem Statement â€“ Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose
value is greater than all of its prior elements. Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the
count of the result.
For example, Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result. 8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all
of its previous elements. Since total of 3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
